                This Pok√©mon likes to lick its palms that are sweetened by being
                soaked in honey. Teddiursa concocts its own honey by blending
                fruits and pollen collected by Beedrill. Blastoise has water
                spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very
                accurate.
